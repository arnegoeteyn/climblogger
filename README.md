# climblogger

## About the project

This is an android application to keep track of climbing routes that you have climbed or are planning to climb.
It's however in a very early alpha stage so it probably won't work if you don't follow my workflow.

## Features

* Create/add/edit ascents/routes/sectors/areas
* Keep track of how much routes you've climbed per grade
